INTRODUCTION: This is the third app in an installment of 25 weekly Python apps, an effort to teach myself Python, Git, and GitHub.

DOCUMENTATION: This app is written in Python 3. When executed, the app asks the user a few trivia questions, one at a time. After each question is asked, the user can hit Enter, or type in a string or multiple strings and then press Enter. Regardless of the user's input, the answer to the question will be revealed, followed by the next question, until there are no more questions left, which ends the program

WHAT I LEARNED: (a) The value of using escape characters in Python, which allows inputting characters that would otherwise not allow the program to run properly. (b) How to make a quick and fun question-and-response game in Python.
